# Projects
Projects folders will contain whole code excerpts that can be ran locally and investigated.
Code will be fully finished and explained with helpful, explanatory comments.

# Supplementary Info
This folder will hold any extra info that is helpful in regards to the course structure and 
underlying fundamentals such as syntax, coding style, and application introduction. (IDE's, file navigation, etc.)
The goal is not to teach or introduce new concepts with supplement info, it is to reinforce and fill in the gaps for 
what I personally believe the course lacks in explanation. This will vary widely as it is primarily aimed towards 
complete beginners with zero experience.

# Exercises
These folders will be split between 3 areas of application similar to the setup of 180 vocareum homework.
Walkthroughs will offer step by step tutorials for creating projects that might aid your understanding of a given week's concepts.
Debugging will aim to offer help through debugging exercises, where code is given and then altered. Answer keys with errors and flaws are given.
Challenges/Exercises will be the closest representation and practice material to the exams given in 180. These will typically be aimed towards a length of 5 questions, all encompassing basic concepts discussed over various weeks prior to the exams. Written code and written explanation will be required. (When progressed to, this step will also deny the use of IDE aid in order to represent exam environment)
