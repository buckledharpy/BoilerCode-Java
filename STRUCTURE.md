# Projects
Projects folders will contain whole code excerpts that can be ran locally and investigated.
Code will be fully finished and explained with helpful, explanatory comments.

# Supplementary Info
This folder will hold any extra info that is helpful in regards to the course structure and 
underlying fundamentals such as syntax, coding style, and application introduction. (IDE's, file navigation, etc.)
The goal is not to teach or introduce new concepts with supplement info, it is to reinforce and fill in the gaps for 
what I personally believe the course lacks in explanation. This will vary widely as it is primarily aimed towards 
complete beginners with zero experience.

# Challenges
This folder will contain short snippets and prompts based on 180 content to prepare you for quizzes and exams.
This is based from LeetCode/Hackerrank like exercises to introduce competitive programming to you in an challenging yet
digestible form. 

# Tutorials
In this folder, there will be both small snippets but mainly prompts that will be supplemented
with multiple sources and information to aid in project creation.
