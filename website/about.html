            <h1>Origin</h1>
            <p>The CS Supplement was founded in 2025 to address the growing need for additional resources in Purdue's computer science curriculum.
                This project was created to help students better understand course material and provide extra practice opportunities outside of the classroom.
                I (Kruz Schurz) started this project after feeling unprepared and overhwhelmed while preparing for my first computer science exam. I wanted
                to create a centralized platform for Purdue CS students to access course based materials and exercises to help them succeed in their studies.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The "CS Supplement" is designed to provide additional resources and support for students enrolled in  Purdue computer science courses.
                This includes access to supplementary materials, study guides, practice exercises to enhance learning outcomes, and primarily offer 
                new programmers a structured way to improve their coding skills outside of regular coursework.</p>
