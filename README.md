# The Goal
This repo is primarily an offered collection of projects, exercises, and resources to use when learning Java alongside CS 180. The goal isn't to pad a ton of small projects onto a repository, rather it is to offer a collection of exercises that might aid your Java knowledge outside of the course and content. Help is always welcome, so reach out, criticize, advise, do anything! This is just an assortment of small, rather basic projects that can help you gain your footing in the world of Java. Projects are not all done, but will be continuously updated. Tutorials and more external resources to come soon.

# Java Projects - The Concept
Practice exercises and small projects in Java! <br />
The personal goal is to commit a project a week to aid with Java proficiency. <br />
I also think that creating one off projects is just fun! <br />

# Disclaimer
Some of these have been derived from tutorials on the web, others are entirely personal, and many are a mix of both! This is just a small
collection meant to give you an idea of where to start, so credit is due to any and all sources that worked in unison to help start this repository.
