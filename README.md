# About
This resource was originally aimed for personal use to aid my friends taking 180 after me. Quickly after exam 1 I realized that CS exam prep and practice was severely lacking. While resources are abundant in person, the action of preparing for a class such as 180 is daunting for new students and especially new programmers. I am one of said new programmers, so it became evident that such a resource and place could become an amazing concept in action if built right. So here we are, aiming to help you, the student, with success beyond class and lecture.

# Disclaimer
These programs are primarily original and created by me. They are inspired and aimed to be as close to 180 content as possible. Exams are not released so that is why this resource exists. It also is a disclaimer to provide a reason for Purdue to not come and obliterate me!
