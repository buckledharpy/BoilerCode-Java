# The Goal
The goal of this repo is just to have a collection of things I can look back on for reference and to offer for other potential new programmers.
The real goal isn't to pad a ton of small projects onto a repository, it's just to offer a collection of exercises that might get your brain thinking in Java.
I know mine sure didn't to begin with, so hopefully if you are reading this, it can help you! And in the likely chance that it cannot, then I challenge you to aid me in creating
an even better repository! Help is always welcome (and isn't that one of the key points of Java's OOP?) so reach out, criticize, advise, do anything! This is just a silly little assortment
of small menial tasks that could help you gain your footing in the world of Java. Start small, and one day you'll get to the exciting large projects (atleast that's what I tell myself).

# Java Projects - The Concept
Practice and small projects in Java! <br />
This Repo is primarily for any personal little exercises or projects I do in Java. <br />
The goal is to commit a project a week to aid with Java proficiency, and so I can look back to these in the future with fondness <br />
I also think that creating one off projects is just fun! It also can offer some beginners some easy options to start creating. <br />

# Thoughts on Java 
Being my first academically taught language, I have to say that Java is interesting to say the least.
The syntax was a mild barrier but I definitely see the appeal of such a high level language.
Although it has it's quirks, when Java runs it runs smooth and nicely. Object Oriented Programming is truly a feat
that I cannot wait to understand more. But for now, these small projects scratch the itch that I have to learn more about
Java. 

# Disclaimer
Some of these have been derived from tutorials, others are entirely personal, and many are both! This is just a small
collection meant to give you an idea of where to start, so there is a level of credit due to any and all sources that worked in unison to help
me start this repository.
